# Warehouse God

> **"На какой бы работе мы не находились, над нами всегда будет стоять ебанный долбоеб... Но что если бы этим долбоебом был ты сам?"**

**Warehouse God** is a first-person 3D puzzle/simulation game about *chaos, control, and your own twisted standards*. Manage an ever-growing warehouse, race against the clock, and survive the consequences of your own perfectionism.

## 🧠 Concept

You're the only worker in a warehouse — but also your own boss. Supplies keep flooding in, deadlines loom, and your internal voice screams for order.  
There’s just one problem: there's never enough time to do everything *right*.

So throw, stack, shove — organize your domain your way. Embrace the chaos, or bend it to your will.  
Whether you rise or crumble is up to **you**.

## 🎮 Gameplay Loop

1. 🚛 **New Delivery**  
   A wave of cargo arrives — a lot of it. More than you can reasonably deal with.

2. ⏳ **Sorting Phase**  
   You have limited time to organize the boxes however you see fit. Stack them, hide them, throw them — whatever works.

3. 📦 **Delivery Phase**  
   Time's up. Now find and deliver the requested items *quickly*. Accuracy and memory are key.

4. 🔁 **Repeat**  
   After three cycles, you enter a **calm phase** where you can tidy up the warehouse and prepare for the next round.

## 🕹️ Player Interactions

- Walk around freely  
- Look around  
- Grab / throw boxes (no need for finesse — *just yeet them toward the courier*)  
- Stack however you like — build towers, mazes, or complete anarchy  

You own the space — the order, the mess, the memory of where the red box went — it’s all *yours*.

## 🧠 The Challenge

> You’ll never have enough time.  
> You’ll never be fully organized.  
> But your memory and instincts? They’re all you’ve got.

Each round tests your ability to adapt and remember. There’s *always* more boxes than you can handle — but that’s the point.

## 🔚 Endgame?

To be revealed. The real question is:  
**How long can you outrun yourself?**
